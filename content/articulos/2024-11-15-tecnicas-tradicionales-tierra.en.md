Earth architecture has been for centuries the most widespread form of building in the world. However, the arrival of industrialized materials in the 20th century relegated these techniques to oblivion in many regions.

## A living heritage

In the Region of Murcia, and especially in the Northwest area, we find numerous examples of earth constructions that have survived the passage of time. These buildings demonstrate that, when correctly executed, traditional techniques can offer exceptional durability.

## Sustainability ahead of its time

What we now call sustainable architecture was, barely a century ago, simply the normal way of building. Local materials, climate adaptation and the use of available resources were fundamental principles that guided master builders.

## Looking to the future

The recovery of these techniques does not mean going backwards, but rather an opportunity to combine ancestral knowledge with current tools and knowledge to create architecture that is more respectful of the environment.
