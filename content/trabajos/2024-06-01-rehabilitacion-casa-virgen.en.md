Casa de la Virgen, built by don Andres de Quesada in the 18th century, is one of the most unique buildings of civil baroque architecture in Caravaca de la Cruz.

## The building

On its facade, a niche with the image of Our Lady of Sorrows was displayed towards the Royal Road to Granada, giving the building its popular name. The interior preserves elements of great heritage value, including a small chamber with a decorated vault.

## Intervention

The rehabilitation project has sought to recover the original values of the building while adapting to current habitability requirements. Traditional construction techniques compatible with historic materials have been used, paying special attention to:

- Structural consolidation of load-bearing walls
- Restoration of the chamber vault
- Recovery of original carpentry
- Improvement of energy efficiency

## Recognition

This project was presented at the XXVI Heritage Conference of the Region of Murcia.
