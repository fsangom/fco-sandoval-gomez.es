The Casa de San Juan de la Cruz, located in Plaza del Templete at the foot of Cuesta de la Cruz, is a building over 400 years old with origins in the second half of the 16th century. According to tradition, it was the dwelling that San Juan de la Cruz rented to initiate the foundation of the Discalced Carmelite convent and the place where the mystic saint stayed during his more than seven visits to the town.

## The building

The property possesses extraordinary heritage and cultural value due to its connection with the figure of the mystic and poet of the Spanish Golden Age. Notably, the building has not undergone significant changes throughout its three centuries of history, preserving its original structure and character.

## Intervention

The interior rehabilitation project has been developed applying bioclimatic construction criteria, focused on environmental efficiency and the preservation of the building's historic character. The intervention has respected the authenticity of the building while adapting it for its new museum use.

Following the first phase of structural consolidation, facade and roof repair executed in 2020, the second phase addressed the comprehensive interior recovery with funding of 166,000 euros from Leader funds of the Rural Development Programme of the Region of Murcia.

## Future use

The restored space will function as a House-Museum divided into three sections:

- An ethnographic area about local history and traditions
- An exhibition space dedicated to San Juan de la Cruz and his legacy
- A contemplation area for spiritual reflection

The goal is to create a dynamic space that addresses mysticism, saints, and teachings about nature and inner thought, strengthening Caravaca's position as a spiritual and cultural tourism destination.
