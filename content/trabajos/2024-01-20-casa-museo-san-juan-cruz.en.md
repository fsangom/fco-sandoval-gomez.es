This building of humble origin is located in the Templete Square of Caravaca de la Cruz (Murcia) and according to oral tradition was the residence that San Juan de la Cruz inhabited during his travels to the town for the foundation of the Discalced Carmelite convent. Historical documentation indicates that the mystical saint rented "a small house from some Moors" in 1586 near the Church of the Immaculate Conception.

## The Building

The property is cataloged in the Urban Planning General Plan of Caravaca de la Cruz with grade 2: structural conservation. It has three floors and is a good example of humble residential architecture that has not undergone significant changes since the 18th century: wooden panel joinery and the only remaining wooden projecting balcony in Caravaca de la Cruz are preserved.

## The Intervention

In 2020, the facades and roof were intervened, but the interior was in very poor condition. In 2021, the project to rehabilitate the property and convert it into the House Museum of San Juan de la Cruz in Caravaca began. The applied criteria were maximum respect for the building's interior and its historical and cultural values, and the use of low environmental impact techniques and materials.

The result of the intervention shows the care taken to preserve the essence of the historic building, maintaining original elements such as the wooden beams and traditional lime finishes.

The recovery of the interior spaces has created a museum itinerary that connects visitors with daily life in the 16th century, respecting the humble scale of the original building and its atmosphere of spiritual recollection.

The materials used—lime, plaster, wood—dialogue with the pre-existing architecture, creating a visual and tactile continuity that reinforces the authenticity of the ensemble.

The program established by the Conde Santa Ana de las Torres Foundation, owner of the building, consisted of reproducing the historical and ethnographic values of the property on the ground floor, creating exhibition rooms on the first floor to bring the life of San Juan de la Cruz and his relationship with Caravaca closer to visitors, and a library and meditation room on the top floor.

The program established by the Conde Santa Ana de las Torres Foundation, owner of the building, consisted of reproducing the historical and ethnographic values of the property on the ground floor, generating exhibition rooms on the first floor that would bring the life of San Juan de la Cruz and his relationship with Caravaca closer to the visitor, and a library and meditation room on the top floor.

To carry this out, a new volume was built next to the patio to house the elevator, emergency staircase, and toilets, in such a way that the historical building would have minimal impact from new installations. This volume was designed with a white facade made of lime mortar to be neutral in relation to the adjacent historical building and guarantee a contemporary reading that would differentiate itself from the pre-existing adjacent facade, while reproducing the triple-row tile eaves to achieve adequate integration.

Inside, the floor joists were designed whose small beams were impossible to reuse with logs and plaster vault in the same way that floor joists of this type of housing have been constructed in the area for centuries. The ground floor space dedicated to kitchen and living room stands out, reproducing the way of life of a humble 16th-century property.
