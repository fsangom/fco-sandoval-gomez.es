The castle of Caravaca de la Cruz, declared a Site of Cultural Interest, houses the Sanctuary of the Vera Cruz and constitutes one of the most important monumental complexes in the Region of Murcia.

## Discovery of the medieval gate

In 2010, during the course of some construction works, the medieval gate of the castle was discovered. This gate was the only access to the enclosure until 1616, when, on the occasion of the construction of the new temple for the Vera Cruz, the basket-handle arch through which access is currently made was opened.

## Study methodology

The work has combined:

- Detailed architectural survey
- Analysis of materials and construction techniques
- Documentary research in historical archives
- Comparative study with other fortifications in the area

## Intervention criteria

Based on the study carried out, intervention criteria have been established that guarantee the conservation of the heritage values of the complex, respecting the different historical phases of the building.
